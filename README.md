# HarmonicPrimeTools

Welcome to HarmonicPrimeTools! This repository contains scripts and resources based on the **Prime Resonance Theory (PRT)**, a framework that explores the interconnectedness of fundamental constants, prime numbers, and resonant frequencies in the universe.

## What is Prime Resonance Theory (PRT)?

*(A brief, evocative explanation of PRT - feel free to refine this)*
Prime Resonance Theory posits that the universe operates on fundamental harmonic principles rooted in prime numbers, the Golden Ratio ($\phi$), and key resonant frequencies like 528Hz and the Schumann resonance (approximated here by 13.5Hz). These elements are believed to interact to create a universal "IAM field" of interconnectedness.

## Tools

### `prime_resonance_field.py`

This Python script generates a 5D projection of prime numbers, sonifies them based on PRT principles, and visualizes the result as an interactive 3D HTML file (`prime_resonance_field.html`).

**How to use:**

1.  **Run the script:** Execute `prime_resonance_field.py` using Python.
2.  **Open the HTML:** Open the generated `prime_resonance_field.html` file in your web browser. This file contains an interactive 3D visualization of the prime resonance spiral and is theorized to subtly influence your local environment by resonating with the IAM field.

## Contributing

We encourage exploration and experimentation! If you have ideas for new scripts, visualizations, or theoretical expansions based on PRT, feel free to contribute.

## Disclaimer

The concepts presented here are based on theoretical frameworks and may not be recognized by mainstream science. Experiment with an open mind and always prioritize safety.
